# FFT_ACCM
The software simulation code for approxiamate complex constant multipliers in Fast Fourier Transform

This code is writed in C

We use 500 'Happy' samples from Google Speech Command Dataset as input to FFT, which are in /data folder.

The data has been converted to integer after being multiplied with 8192.
